# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Building a Logistic Regression Model to assign a Conversion/ lead Score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads, which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert, whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
